# The Legend of Sadness

The same game as [This one](akihabara.github.com/demo-tlos) but made with Akihabara 2.0.
The original game was made by [Kesiev](http://kesiev.com).

### Experimental Netwirking 

Adapting from the example: http://buildnewgames.com/real-time-multiplayer/

Attempt is to mimic the functionality of the example but in the akihabara 2.0 engine. 
This will be dependant on the use of node.js.

#### Installing

Download node.js with npm, then, while in the current running directory run:

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```
